Edge Detection Program
This repository contains an Edge Detection Program designed to identify and highlight edges in images or video streams using advanced image processing techniques. The program leverages popular computer vision libraries to provide fast, accurate, and customizable edge detection capabilities for various applications.

Features
Image Edge Detection:
Supports common edge detection algorithms like Sobel, Canny, Prewitt, and Laplacian.
Handles multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.).
Real-Time Video Processing:
Detects edges in live video streams from a webcam or video files.
Customizable Parameters:
Adjust thresholds and kernel sizes for precise control over edge detection.
Visualization Tools:
Displays original and processed images/videos side-by-side for comparison.
